# CEO Slayer 24
**CEO Slayer 24** is a heart-pounding, claim-denying shooter game—not to be mistaken for GTA.

## Overview
This is an open-source project designed to serve as both a fun game and a boilerplate/template for bigger, better games. While the current version is simple, it's a great starting point for developers who want to improve it, create mods, or build entirely new levels.

### Current Version
**CEO Slayer v2.86** (first release!)

The entire game is contained in a single HTML file, making it easy to run and modify.

## Live Demo
Play the game here: [CEO Slayer Live Demo](http://ceoslayer.likesyou.org)

## Running the Game
There are multiple ways to run CEO Slayer:

1. **JSFiddle:** Copy the HTML file into the "HTML" section of [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net) to run/test it.
2. **Webserver:** Upload the HTML file to a webserver. (Free hosting is available from [Infinity Free](https://www.infinityfree.net).)

## Contributions Welcome
I’ve put a lot of time into this game, but there’s plenty of room for improvement! Here’s how you can contribute:
- Enhance gameplay mechanics.
- Develop your own versions or mods.
- Create additional levels (e.g., Level 2 and beyond).

The game isn’t perfect—just like our healthcare system. Burn.

**Defend. Deny. Depose.**
