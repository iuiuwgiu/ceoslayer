CEO Slayer 24 is a heard-pounding, claim-denying shooter game - not to be mistaken for GTA.


Check out the Releases tab to download the Source code.

CEO Slayer v2.86 (first release!)

The CEO Slayer game is contained in one single HTML file.  

Live Demo:
[http://ceoslayer.likesyou.org](http://ceoslayer.likesyou.org)

This HTML file can be placed into the "HTML" section at jsfiddle.net to be run / tested.  

Or just put it on a webserver (free hosting is available from "infinity free")

Please improve this game, make your own versions, mods, Level 2, etc.



This game is intended as a boilerplate / template for bigger, better games.

I already put enough time into this, so someone else should add to it now.

The game isn't perfect - just like our healthcare system.  Burn.
